// State colours for the ambient surfaces.
//
// The problem: every state used one accent plus red for failure, so listening,
// thinking, and answering were indistinguishable.
//
// The constraint: Omarchy's public theme roles are foreground, background,
// accent, urgent, and muted. The raw terminal palette (a green, an amber) is
// read by Color.qml only as a fallback for those five and is never exposed, and
// reading colors.toml here would duplicate the shell's theming and break the
// rule that colours resolve from qs.Commons roles.
//
// So the states are derived from the theme's own accent by rotating hue while
// keeping its saturation and lightness. That has a real tradeoff worth stating:
// it gives up the green-means-done convention, because an absolute green would
// clash with a warm theme and would collide with the accent outright in a green
// one. Relative spacing is instead guaranteed distinct in every theme, and every
// state still reads as belonging to the palette. Failure keeps `urgent`, which
// is the one role a theme defines specifically to mean "something is wrong".

// Hue offsets in turns (1.0 == 360°). Spaced far enough apart to be
// unambiguous at a glance, even bloomed and at low opacity.
var LISTENING_SHIFT = 0.0;    // the theme accent itself
var THINKING_SHIFT = 0.11;    // ~40°
var ANSWERING_SHIFT = 0.30;   // ~108°

// A plain string has no hslHue/hslSaturation, so callers passing "#rrggbb"
// would silently produce NaN and collapse every state to one colour. Qt.darker
// with a factor of 1 is the cheapest reliable string-to-color coercion.

  // for the rotation to be visible at all — rotating hue on a grey yields grey.
